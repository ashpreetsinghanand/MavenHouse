Your authorized agent may make a request on your behalf upon our verification of the agent’s identity and our receipt of a copy of a valid power of attorney given to your authorized agent pursuant to California Probate Code Sections 4000-4465. If you have not provided your agent with such a power of attorney, you must provide your agent with written and signed permission to exercise your CCPA rights on your behalf, provide the information we request to verify your identity, and provide us with written confirmation that you have given the authorized agent permission to submit the request.

See the cookies section above for information on how to opt-out of use of your Personal Information for interest based advertising. You may submit requests to exercise your right to opt-out of the sale of your Personal Information by contacting us or here: Do Not Sell My Personal Information</p>
